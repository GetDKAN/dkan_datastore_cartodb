DKAN Datastore CartoDB Integration
======================

This module extends the DKAN Datastore to provide CartoDB integration.

When enabled the "Datastore" functionality is completely offloaded to CartoDB.

Files are uploaded to DKAN and posted to CartodB and stored as tables.

The CartoDB SQL API is made available for querying instead of the native DKAN Datastore API.

This module is still in development.
